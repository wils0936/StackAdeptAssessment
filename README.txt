Hello,

This file will help explain the necessary information to share with the viewers at Stackadept.

Most elements in the HTML file are necessary. The only element(s) that may be confusing are the paragraphs of filler words aka Lorem Ipsum. 
These words are merely to allow for the window to be scrolled highlighting the advertisement banner to remain at the bottom of the viewport. 

In the JS I utilized a timeout function to have the ad pop-up after a second. 
I aimed to demonstrate my understanding that ads may pop-up on screen after some time or triggered by other events from the website.

This would be a first prototype demonstrating functionality.

Please refer to index.js to see documentation on the functionality created. 

Please refer to snippet.js to view task 2 of the assessment.
