/* The code is creating an array `arr` with values [1, 2, 3]. It then defines an immediately invoked
function expression (IIFE) that takes no parameters. Inside the function, it declares a variable
`num` with a value of 1. It then checks if the value at the index `num` in the `arr` array is equal
to 2. If it is, it logs the message "the second index is: 2" to the console. However, since the IIFE
is not invoked, the code inside the function will not be executed. */

// Looking at the function from a different, more broad, perspective, I would ask what the point of the function is to the developer.
// The function provides the num variable as the number 1 then does a single comparison targeting the value by index with a direct comparator.
// I would then provide help to the developer in the form of creating more complex functionality and targeting using a loop.
// Furthermore, I would provide the developer with an explanation and demonstration of some form of catch for the if statement, such as using an else statement.
// This would create some feedback on the function running but not as expected rather than no running due to some other unseen issue.
